# 2. Project Language

Date: 2020-08-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For this project I can either use Go or Python.

## Decision

Use Go.

While I am more familiar with Python, I haven't done any extensive API
programming in either language. My most recent experience with API development
is helping troubleshoot node.js rest backend. I have been intending to take a
deeper dive into Go, and the overall structure of a restful api in go lang
looks similar to the node.js work I have done. 

## Consequences

Development will require some foundational understanding of Go and popular Go
modules for developing REST APIs.
